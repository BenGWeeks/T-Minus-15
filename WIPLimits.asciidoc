== WIP Limits

WIP (Work in Progress) Limits are constraints on the number of items (e.g. Features or Stories) that can be in progress at any one time. The purpose of WIP Limits is to prevent multitasking, promote focus, and improve flow. By limiting the number of items in progress, you ensure that the team is working on the most important items first and delivering value more quickly.

WIP Limits also help to reduce context switching, reduce waste, and increase team velocity. WIP Limits should be set based on team capacity and the nature of the work. When used correctly, WIP Limits can have a profound impact on the quality and speed of delivery in agile environments.

In summary, we would much rather deliver 8 Features in a Sprint that are of high-value and high-quality than say 10 Features that are buggy and therefore of less value to the business.

Decide what your own teams WIP limits should be. These can be a set value or a multiple of the number of team members performing that role.
