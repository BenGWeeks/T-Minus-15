design_rules: >
  - **Reusable component-first approach**: Don't leave creating components to the end or have unnecessary duplication of design assets. Start with reusable components to maintain consistency.
  - **Minimal layers**: Reduce the number of layers to the bare minimum—less is more. Streamline design for easier navigation and better performance.
  - **PascalCase for layer naming**: Use logical, consistent naming for layers (e.g., ButtonPrimary, CardHeader) rather than generic names like Frame1, Frame2, etc.
  - **Export assets to Git**: Ensure all required images are exported to the Git repository for easy access and version control.
  - **Accessibility considerations**: Prioritize accessibility by using contrasting colors, ensuring readable font sizes, and providing options for visually impaired users.
  - **Auto Layout with Figma**: Use Figma’s Auto Layout to position elements dynamically. This ensures consistency and responsiveness, making it easier for AI agents to interpret and code your design into working components.
  - **Design with developer collaboration in mind**: Create design assets like images, fonts, and icons with developers in mind. Provide clear, scalable assets (e.g., SVGs) and detailed export instructions.
  - **Submit pull requests with developer-ready assets**: When design work is finalized, submit pull requests with the necessary assets and documentation. Ensure the PR is well-organized and includes everything the developers need to implement the designs effectively (e.g., file structures, naming conventions, usage guidelines).
  - **Consistency across design systems**: Ensure that all UI components align with the established design system to maintain uniformity across projects. Reuse existing patterns, typography, and color schemes to ensure a cohesive design language.
  - **Keep the user flow simple**: Avoid overly complex navigation structures. Focus on keeping the user flow intuitive and minimizing the number of actions needed to achieve user goals.
  - **Use grids for alignment**: Use consistent grid systems for alignment and spacing. This helps in creating designs that are balanced and well-proportioned, making it easier for the developer to replicate.
  - **Consider mobile-first design**: Start with a mobile-first approach and scale up to larger screens. This ensures that designs are optimized for smaller screens first, where performance and usability matter most.
  - **Scalable and adaptable designs**: Ensure that your designs can easily scale and adapt to different screen sizes, resolutions, and devices. Consider how elements will respond and rearrange as the screen size changes.
  - **Maintain performance optimization**: Be mindful of file sizes, image compression, and the overall performance of the design. Large files can slow down the design process and the final product.
  - **Version control for design files**: Regularly update and commit design files to version control. This ensures that you can easily track changes, roll back if needed, and collaborate with the team more efficiently.
