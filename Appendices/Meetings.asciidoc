== Meetings That Don't Suck

=== Mission Control: Your Monthly Command Center

**Why have it?** This is your strategic checkpoint. Keep stakeholders aligned, surface blockers before they become disasters, and make sure the rocket stays on course.

**When?** Monthly - put it on everyone's calendar as a recurring appointment

**Who needs to be there?** Scrum Masters and key Stakeholders (the people who can actually make decisions)

**What to cover:**
- 5 min: Quick wins from the past month (always start positive!)
- 15 min: Progress against key milestones and metrics
- 15 min: Roadblocks that need stakeholder intervention
- 10 min: Upcoming decisions and resource needs
- 5 min: Action items and owners

=== T-Plus Support Check-ins: Keep the Engine Running

**Why have it?** Your software is live, but your job isn't done. These meetings ensure your solution keeps delivering value long after the champagne bottles are empty.

**When?** Monthly - schedule them for 6 months post-launch minimum

**Who needs to be there?** Stakeholders and whoever owns the solution now

**What to cover:**
- Usage metrics and adoption trends (are people actually using what you built?)
- Performance against original success criteria
- User feedback and enhancement requests
- Support ticket patterns and resolution times
- Quick wins for the next month

=== Project Landing: The Smooth Touchdown

**Why have it?** Don't just abandon your project - give it a proper handoff. This meeting closes the loop, captures lessons, and ensures a smooth transition to business-as-usual support.

**When?** Schedule it for the final day of your last sprint, after you've deployed to production

**Who needs to be there?** Scrum Master, Operations Manager, and key Stakeholders

**What to cover:**
- Showcase what you've actually delivered vs. what was promised
- Budget transparency - where the money went and any variance
- Official project archiving (close it in your time tracking system)
- Customer feedback collection (use a standardized survey)
- Formal handover to the Operations Manager (introduce them!)
- Clear explanation of how support works going forward
