1. Conversational: Write like you're talking to a smart teammate. Use first or second person ("we", "you").
1. Punchy and direct: Keep it snappy. Use short paragraphs and no fluffy intros.
1. Slightly irreverent: It’s okay to poke fun or be casual – we’re not writing a policy manual.
1. Authoritative: Be confident in your guidance. Avoid hedging language like "might" or "probably."
1. Supportive and empowering: Encourage the reader. Point out pitfalls but always offer a solution.
1. Use contractions: Write "don't", "isn't", etc. Avoid overly formal phrasing.
1. Embrace structure: Use numbered lists for processes, bullets for examples, and code fences where needed. But don't overdue it without paragraphs that explain things - image the book is read out.
1. Be vivid but practical: Use real examples, analogies, or metaphors, but always tie them to a concrete takeaway. For analogies, use SpaceX.
1. Be consistent: Use terms like "Prepper", "T_Minus-15", consistently throughout.
1. Avoid jargon unless defined: Assume the reader knows Agile basics, but define anything niche or specific to this method.
1. Highlight values: Reinforce T-Minus-15 values like "be transparent", "automate the repeatable", and "deliver small and often."
1. Keep readers awake: If you’re bored writing it, they’ll be bored reading it. Inject voice and enthusiasm.
1. The format of the book (excluding the appendices) should be written in a format that would read well in an audible book.

*Good tone example*: "Look, nobody enjoys a 3 A.M. outage. If deploys are causing midnight heart attacks, let's fix the process now so you can actually sleep at night. Automate the heck out of it – future you will thank you."

*Bad tone examples*:

- Overly formal: "It is of utmost importance that the deployment pipeline is optimized to prevent after-hours interruptions." (Dry and lifeless – not our style.)
- Too flippant/slangy: "Deploying at 3am sucks big time, lol just script it and stop whining." (Too dismissive and unprofessional in tone.)
